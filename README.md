# How-to-Predict-Stock-Prices-Easily-Demo

##Overview

I use an [LSTM neural network](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) to predict the closing price of the S&P 500 using a dataset of past prices.

##Dependencies

* keras
* tensorflow

Install Keras from [here](https://keras.io/) and Tensorflow from [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup). 

##Usage

Run this using [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). Just type `jupyter notebook` in the main directory and the code will pop up in a browser window.
